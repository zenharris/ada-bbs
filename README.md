# ada-bbs

An ncurses based small menu system, IRC client and general purpose input line editor/text editor all under development to create a BBS system written in Ada.

Now incudes Postgresql database scroller which requires Gnatcoll Postgresql. If you remove references to the Dbase objects in main it will compile without Gnatcoll. 

The Database scroller has now become a database game in the form of a MMO space ship simmulator. Good luck to anyone
who can compile and run it. I'd realy like to know if anyone ever gets it going.

Thanks to Irc.bot code https://github.com/erik/ada-irc with which I made the IRC client.
